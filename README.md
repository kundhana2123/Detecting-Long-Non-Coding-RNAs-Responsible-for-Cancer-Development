# Detecting-Long-Non-Coding-RNAs-Responsible-for-Cancer-Development

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play an important role in cancer development, but identifying the key cancer-related lncRNAs is challenging due to the high dimensionality of gene expression data. In this project, we analyzed expression profiles of 12,309 lncRNAs from 2,221 patients across five cancer types: bladder, colon, cervical, liver, and head & neck cancer.

We built a machine learning framework using multiple classification models and applied feature selection techniques to reduce noise and identify the most informative lncRNAs. The approach identified 234 key lncRNAs that effectively distinguish between cancer types. Among the models tested, Support Vector Machine (SVM) achieved the best performance with 98.2% accuracy. Correlation analysis further validated the biological relevance of the selected lncRNAs.
